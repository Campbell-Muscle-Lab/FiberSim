# Installation

These pages discuss how to install FiberSim and the necessary support software.

## Getting Started With FiberPy

To get started with FiberPy, you must set up the [Anaconda Environment](http://campbell-muscle-lab.github.io/howtos_Python/pages/anaconda/anaconda.html) for FiberSim. To do this, follow the instructions under the [Python Setup](python_setup/python_setup.md). The environment file that you will be using is located at `FiberSim/code/FiberPy/environment/environment.yml` and the environment is named "FiberSim".

## Using The FiberPy Environment

To use the FiberPy environment that you installed with [Getting Started with FiberPy](#getting-started-with-fiberpy), you must activate the environment. To do this, follow the steps [at this link](http://localhost:4000/pages/anaconda/anaconda.html#executing-python-py-files), replacing `myenv` with `FiberSim`.
