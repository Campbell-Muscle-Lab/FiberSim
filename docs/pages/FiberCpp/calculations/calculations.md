# Calculations

FiberSim is a spatially-explicit model of a half-sarcomere. It describes a compliant network of protein filaments, which is detailed below.

## Actin filaments

Thin filaments are composed of nodes joined by linear springs of stiffness $k_{a}$ with a resting length $a_{rl}$. If the position of the $i^{th}$ node along an x-axis is noted $a_i$, then the force-balance equations for the thin filament can be written as:

$` 2 \, k_a \, a_1 - k_a \, a_2 = 0`$

$ -  k_a \, a_{i-1} + 2 \, k_a \, a_i - k_a \, a_{i+1} = 0 \,\,\, \text{for} \, 1 \lt i \lt n$

$ -k_a \, a_{n-1} + k_a \, a_n = k_a \, a_{rl}$

## Myosin filaments

Thick filaments are composed of nodes joined by linear springs of stiffness $k_{m}$ with a resting length $m_{rl}$. A rigid link of length $\lambda$ connects the thick filament to the M-line. If the position of the $i^{th}$ node along an x-axis is noted $m_i$, and the half-sarcomere length is noted $l_{hs}$, then the force-balance equations for the thick filament can be written as:

$ 2 \, k_m \, m_1 - k_m \, m_2 = k_m \, (l_{hs}- \lambda)$

$ -  k_m \, m_{i-1} + 2 \, k_m \, m_i - k_m \, m_{i+1} = 0 \,\,\, \text{for} \, 1 \lt i \lt n$

$k_m \, m_{n-1} - k_m \, m_n = k_m \, m_{rl}$

The system of equations for the thin and thick filament can be written in matrix form:

$K x = F$ 

where $K$ is a matrix containing the springs stiffness, $x$ is a vector containing the positions of the actin and myosin nodes ($a_i$ and $m_i$, respectively) and $F$ is a vector containing the constant terms (independent of nodes positions). $K$ is a tridiagonal matrix:

</p>


and numerical methods exist to solve $Kx=F$ for $x$.


## Cross-bridge links 

Myosin heads located at the thick filament nodes can attach to neighboring binding sites at the thin filament nodes, thus affecting the filament lattice framework.

</p>

A cross-bridge located at the $j^{th}$ thick filament node which attaches to the $i^{th}$ node of the thin filament generates a force $f_{cb}$ given by:

$f_{cb} = k_{cb} \, (m_j - a_i + x_{ps})$

where  $k_{cb}$ is the cross-bridge spring stiffness and $x_{ps}$ is the crossbridge extension when deploying the power stroke.

This additional force on the filaments should be added to the force-balance equations :

$-  k_a \, a_{i-1} + 2 \, k_a \, a_i - k_a \, a_{i+1} \, \color{red}{+ \, k_{cb} \, a_i - k_{cb} \, m_j} = \color{blue}{k_{cb} \, x_{ps}}$

$-  k_m \, m_{j-1} + 2 \, k_m \, m_j - k_m \, m_{j+1} \, \color{red}{- \, k_{cb} \, a_i + k_{cb} \, m_j} = \color{blue}{-k_{cb} \, x_{ps}}$

The terms in red will add non-tridiagonal, opposite elements to the $K$ matrix:

</p>

while the blue terms will contribute to the $F$ vector. 

Cross-bridge linking toughens the numerical solving of $K x = F$, which notably requires an iterative procedure to find a solution $x$ that satisfies a certain precision. 

## Titin 

Titin is responsible for the passive force developing within the half-sarcomere when it is stretched, and for the recoil force when it is shortened. In the model, it is assumed that titin is a linear spring of stiffness $k_t$ and rest length $t_{rl}$. This spring is attached at both ends, on a particular thick and thin filament node respectively. Similar to crossbridge links, titin adds some force contribution $f_{t}$ to the force-balance equations:

$f_{t} = k_{t} \, (m_l - a_k - t_{rl})$

## Myosin Binding Protein C

Myosin Binding Protein C (MyBP-C) is a striated muscle contracting protein. It is associated with the thick filaments and located near the center of the sarcomere, in the C-zones.

This protein interacts both with myosin and actin and is a modulator of cardiac contractility. In the model, MyBPC can attach to an actin binding site and act as a "non-force-generating cross-bridge link" (meaning it cannot undergo a power stroke). Such C-links contribute to the force-balance equations:

 $f_{pc} = k_{pc} \, (m_j - a_i)$
 
 where  $k_{pc}$ is the C-link stiffness.
