# Testing suite

At each time step, FiberCpp calculates the position of each thick and thin filaments node by solving the force-balance matrix equation (see [here](../calculations/calculations.md) for more information). FiberCpp also computes the kinetics for the actin binding sites and the myosin/myosin-binding protein C molecules. In order to make sure that the calculations are done properly, we have developed a testing suite in Python.
