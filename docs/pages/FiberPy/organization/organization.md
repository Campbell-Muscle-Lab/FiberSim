# Organization

FiberPy is computer code that interfaces with FiberCpp and makes it easier to use FiberSim for research.

The simplest thing with FiberPy is run a simulation. As shown below, you can do this by passing three files to FiberPy. It will transfer these files to FiberCpp, coordinate the simulation, save the results to a new file, and plot the results.

See the [demos](../../demos/demos.html) for examples.

[Structures](../../structures/structures.html) provides information about the different files that FiberSim uses.
