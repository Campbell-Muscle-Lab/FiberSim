# FiberPy

[FiberPy](../../../FiberPy/FiberPy.html) is a suite of software tools which make it easier to use [FiberCpp](../FiberCpp/FiberCpp.html) to
+ run simulations
+ analyze the output of the simulation
+ make figures
+ fit models to experimental data
+ are written in Python for flexility

Most end-users will use the FiberPy suite to perform most of their work. Only people who want to add new features to the core model need to work directly with the FiberCpp system.
