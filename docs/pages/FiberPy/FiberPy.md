# FiberPy

FiberPy is a suite of software tools witten in Python that make it easier to use the core [FiberCpp](../FiberCpp/FiberCpp.html) model to

+ run simulations
+ analyze the output of the simulation
+ make figures

FiberPy can also use [Blender](http://www.blender.org) to create snapshots of the model and movies.

While speed is the most important factor for the core model, flexibility is more important for FiberPy. The suite is therefore written in Python making extensive use of existing libraries including [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

The [demos](../demos/demos.html) provide many examples.
