# FiberPy

FiberPy is a suite of software tools witten in Python that make it easier to use [FiberCpp](../FiberCpp/FiberCpp.html) to
+ run simulations
+ analyze the output of the simulation
+ make figures
+ fit models to experimental data

as explained in the [Structure](structure/structure.html) section.

FiberPy can also use [Blender](http://www.blender.org) to create snapshots of the model and movies.

The [demos](../demos/demos.html) provide many examples.
