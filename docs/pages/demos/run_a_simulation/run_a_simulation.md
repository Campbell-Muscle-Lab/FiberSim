# Running a Simulation
{:.no_toc}

{:toc}

This section of demos demonstrate how to run simulations using the FiberSim model. The following is a list of demos and a brief description of them:
  + The [simple demo](simple/simple.md) runs an isometric simulation at constant pCa.
  + The [isotonic demo](isotonic/isotonic.md) showcases the isotonic mode of FiberSim that allows for emulation of tension-control experiments.
  + The [stretch demo](stretch/stretch.md) shows simulation of a ramp stretch at constant pCa.
