# Single run

## Overview

This demo shows you how to run a single simulation in FiberSim.

If you read the documentation, you will see that FiberSim is composed of several parts
+ the [core model](../core_model/core_model.html)
  + which implements the calculations underlying the simulation
  + is written in C++
  + is a console application stored as FiberSim.exe in `repo/bin`
+ the [interface](../inteface/interface.html)
  + which provides functions that simplify
    + simplify running simulations
    + analyzing the output
    + fitting models to experimental data
  + is written in Python
