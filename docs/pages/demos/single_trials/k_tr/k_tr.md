# Activation with a k_tr maneuver

## Overview

This demo shows how to simulate a single k_tr experiment.

## What this demo does

This demo:

+ Runs a single simulation in which a half-sarcomere is activated in pCa 4.5 and then subjected to a k_tr maneuver
+ Plots a summary of the simulation

## Instructions

If you need help with these step, check the [installation instructions](../../../installation/installation.html).

+ Open an Anaconda prompt
+ Activate the FiberSim environment
+ Change directory to `<FiberSim_repo>/code/FiberPy/FiberPy`
+ Run the command
```
 python FiberPy.py characterize "../../../demo_files/single_trials/k_tr/base/setup.json"
 ```

### Viewing the results

All of the results from the simulation are written to files in `<FiberSim_repo>/demo_files/single_trials/k_tr/sim_data/sim_output`

The file `superposed_traces.png` shows pCa, length, force per cross-sectional area (stress), and thick and thin filamnt properties plotted against time.

Since the code simulated a k<sub>tr</sub> maneuver, FiberPy also created a figure showing the analyis of the tension recovery.

Data quantifying the k<sub>tr</sub> are written to `<FiberSim_repo>/demo_files/single_trials/k_tr/sim_data/sim_output/k_tr_analysis.xlsx`

### How this worked

The only difference between this simulation and the [isometric activation example](../isometric_activation/isometric_activation.html) are a few extra lines in the characteriztion structure of the setup file.

Note the parameters starting with `k_tr`. These describe:

| Parameter | Sets |
| ----| ---------|
|k_tr_start_s | The start time for the k_tr maneuver |
|k_tr_duration_s | How long the k_tr lasts |
|k_tr_ramp_s | The duration of the length changes |
|k_tr_magnitude_nm | The magnitude of the length change (per half-sarcomere) |
|k_tr_fit_time_s | The portion of the record that the code will fit a single exponential to |
