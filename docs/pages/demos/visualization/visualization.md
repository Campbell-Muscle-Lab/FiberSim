# Blender Visualization Pipeline

## Overview

FiberSim can take 'snap-shots' that describe the status of every molecule in the myofibrillar lattice at a given moment. FiberSim's visualization pipeline uses [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) to turn these snap-shots into a 3D scene that can be useful for trouble-shooting or simply watching how the model works.

It's also possible to save a view of the 3D scene as a 2D image. This is called [rendering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_rendering). Rendering successive snap-shots, potentially moving the view-point each time, generates a sequence of images that can ultimately be stitched together to make a movie.

This section provides demos for both of these processes.
