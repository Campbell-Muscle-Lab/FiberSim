## Electrical stimulation

Living muscles are electrically excitable with contraction being activated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient.

FiberSim can create protocol files that include Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients generated by a single two compartment model.

### Model

The model has two compartments representating the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca<sup>2+</sup> store) and myofilament space respectively.

The equations defining the model are as follows, where Ca<sub>x</sub> is the Calcium concentration in compartment x.

$$
Ca_{SR} + Ca_{myofil} = Ca_{content}
$$

$$
\frac{\mathrm d Ca_{SR}}{\mathrm dt} = 
\begin{cases}
t \leq stimulus\_duration\_s & k_{SERCA} Ca_{myofil} - (k_{leak} + k_{act}) * Ca_{SR} \\
t > stimulus\_duration\_s & k_{SERCA} Ca_{myofil} - k_{leak} * Ca_{SR}
\end{cases}
$$

$$
\frac{\mathrm d Ca_{myofil}}{\mathrm dt} = -\frac{\mathrm d Ca_{SR}}{\mathrm dt}
$$


| Parameter | Sets |
| ----| ---------|
|Ca_content | The total Ca<sup>2+</sup> (M) |
|stimulus_duration_s | How long Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the sarcoplasmic reticulum after a stimulus (s)|
|k_leak | The rate at which Ca<sup>2+</sup> leaks from the sarcoplasmic reticulum when there is no stimulus (M s<sup>-1</sup>)|
|k_act | The additive rate at which Ca<sup>2+</sup> is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum during a stimulus (M s<sup>-1</sup>)|
|k_serca | The rate at which Ca<sup>2+</sup> is pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (M s<sup>-1</sup>)|
