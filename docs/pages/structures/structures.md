# Structures

FiberSim uses several different types of structure to control simulations and store results.

Whenever possible, the structures are defined in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) so that are easy to handle with computer code but also human-readable.

This section provides details about these structures.

The [demos](../demos/demos.html) provide many examples.
