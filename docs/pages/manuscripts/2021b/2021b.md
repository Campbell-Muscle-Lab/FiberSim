This page shows how to reproduce: 

+ Tension-pCa curves with and without an MyBPC SRX stabilizing effect/actin binding effect
+ A Mavacamten dose-dependent response curve
+ Slack-restretch (k_tr) simulations for 1 or 3 potential binding sites for myosin

These simulations data are part of a published manuscript ("FiberSim: A flexible open-source model of myofilament-level contraction", [10.1016/j.bpj.2021.12.021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000634952103945X)), and they were run using FiberSim version **2.0.2** (you can download it [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5783975)).
