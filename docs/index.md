# FiberSim

FiberSim is software for spatially-explicit modeling of half-sarcomeres. The code tracks the position and status of each myosin head, each binding site on actin, and each molecule of myosin-bindin protein C.

The main components are:
+ [FiberCpp](pages/FiberCpp/FiberCpp.html) - the core model which implements the calculations underlying the simulations
+ [FiberPy](pages/FiberPy/FiberPy.html) - code that makes it easier to use the software to perform numerical experiments.

The [demos](pages/demos/demos.html) show how to visualize the model, as in the picture below.
